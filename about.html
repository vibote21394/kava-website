          Real kava, derived from the root of the kava plant (Piper methysticum),
          has a unique and earthy taste that can be described as mildly bitter and
          peppery, with a slightly woody or musty flavor. Its taste is often
          compared to the flavor of damp soil or an herbal tea, with a somewhat
          numbing or tingling sensation that is felt on the tongue and lips. This
          numbing effect is due to the kavalactones, the active compounds in kava,
          which also contribute to its calming and relaxing properties. The flavor
          of kava can vary slightly depending on the preparation method and the
          region where its grown, but it is generally an acquired taste. Many
          people find it an intense experience at first, though it becomes more
          familiar with regular consumption. The taste is often softened or masked
          when kava is blended into drinks or mixed with sweeteners.
